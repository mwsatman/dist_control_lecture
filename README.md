# dist_control_lecture
This repository contains the basic simulation code to test control algorithm for ground mobile robots,
specifically prepared for exercise on the course: Distributed Control and Optimization of Cyber-Physical Systems AUT.360.

## Usage

Dependency: Numpy, Matplotlib, and qpsolvers

Description on the scripts:
1. ```single_robot_case.py``` : main simulation code for single robot
2. ```multi_robot_case.py``` : main simulation code for 4 robots
3. ```exercise_code.py``` : the template for controller and state updated. Will be edited during exercise.
4. ```visualize_mobile_robot.py``` : library for visualizing the robot

**WARNING!**
The simulation code have not been tested with Spyder or PyCharm. 
It is highly suggested to run the code via Visual Studio or just via command line.

## Contributor and Maintainter

The basic simulation in this repository are developed and maintained by Made Widhi Surya Atman from Intelligent Networked Systems (IINES) Group, Faculty of Engineerings and Natural Sciences, Tampere University.
